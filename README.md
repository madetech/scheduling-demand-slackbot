## Developer's guide
// TO DO
### Prerequisites
For local development you will need to install:

* [Node Js + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node 4.7.4 or later,
* [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) - clasp is an open source tool that allows you to develop and manage Apps Script projects from your terminal rather than the Apps Script editor.

You will also need to enable the Google Apps Script API because thatâ€™s what clasp uses in the background. In order to do this please:
1. navigate to the Apps Script Settings page,
2. click on "Google Apps Script API",
3. toggle the switch to "on".
